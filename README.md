What is Currency Converter?
---------------------------

A currency converter is website that is designed to convert one currency into another in order to check its corresponding value and it is based on current market or bank exchange rates.  
  
In order to convert one currency into another, a user enters an amount of money (e.g. '1000') and chooses the currency he/she wishes to check the monetary value of (e.g. 'United States Dollar'). After that, the user selects one, or sometimes several other currencies, he/she would like to see the result in. The application software then calculates and displays the corresponding amount of money.If you want to see an advanced currency converter,click [here](https://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/).

I used [Alpha Vantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/) free account so currency values are updated everytime . Plus this, the design is quite simple.
